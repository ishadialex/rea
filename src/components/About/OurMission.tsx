                The greatest advantage lies in the fact that you can profit from property without having to purchase it. No hefty deposits or mortgages are necessary to begin! We're accustomed to the concept of major corporations managing assets rather than possessing them outright, resulting in highly lucrative enterprises.

                Consider Uber, the leading taxi service globally, which doesn't own any vehicles.Or Facebook, the most prominent social media platform, which generates no content of its own.Similarly, Airbnb, the largest accommodation provider worldwide, doesn't own any real estate.

                This strategy operates on the principle of control rather than ownership.
